The essay partially addresses the task by discussing both perspectives on teaching recycling, which is a strength. The introduction sets up the discussion appropriately, and examples are provided, such as the importance of education in schools and parental influence at home. However, the focus on "green energy" at the beginning may detract from the central topic of recycling. Additionally, the conclusion lacks a strong reiteration of the key points made, weakening overall clarity. To enhance task achievement, the writer should maintain a clear focus on recycling throughout and make explicit connections to the prompt in the conclusion for a more cohesive argument.
