The essay addresses the task by discussing both opinions on whether recycling should be taught at school or home, which is a clear strength. It presents a relevant position, suggesting that both environments are important for teaching children about recycling. However, the development of ideas is somewhat weak; for example, the argument for teaching recycling at school lacks depth and could benefit from more specific examples or elaboration. Moreover, the conclusion reiterates the main points but could be clearer and more concise. Overall, while the essay meets the task requirements, further development and clearer examples would enhance the effectiveness of the arguments presented.
