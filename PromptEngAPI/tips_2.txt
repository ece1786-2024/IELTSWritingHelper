To enhance the effectiveness of your IELTS Task 2 essay, consider focusing on deepening your arguments and improving your language precision. While you successfully address both perspectives regarding the teaching of recycling at school and home, the development of your ideas often lacks detail and specificity. For example, when discussing the role of schools, you could elaborate further by mentioning specific programs or initiatives that schools could implement, such as establishing recycling clubs or conducting environmental science classes that highlight local recycling efforts. This would not only strengthen your argument but also provide clear examples to support your points.

Additionally, improving the clarity of your transitions will enhance coherence. For instance, instead of saying, "while waste management is a profound topic," you could say, "While waste management is undoubtedly important, the way schools educate students about it can profoundly impact their understanding and actions." This helps create a smoother flow between ideas. It's also essential to ensure that your references are clear; rather than using vague phrases like "these materials" or "this behaviour," specify what you mean by redesigning sentences to include direct references such as "recycling plastic waste" or "the habit of segregating household waste."

Further, pay attention to your word choice and grammatical accuracy. For instance, the phrase "is been regarded" should be corrected to "is regarded" to eliminate grammatical errors. Aim for variety in vocabulary to demonstrate lexical range; instead of repeating words like "waste," consider synonyms such as "refuse" or "recyclables."

Lastly, your conclusion could benefit from greater conciseness. Rather than reiterating all points, try synthesizing your ideas into a more succinct statement that emphasizes the value of education in recycling both at school and home. Refining these aspects will lead to a more polished and persuasive essay.
