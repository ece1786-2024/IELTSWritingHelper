The essay demonstrates a reasonable grammatical range with attempts to use both simple and complex sentences. However, there are notable weaknesses in grammatical accuracy. For instance, "Green energy is been regarded" contains an incorrect verb form, leading to confusion. Additionally, punctuation errors such as the missing space after commas make certain sentences difficult to read. There is a commendable effort to present arguments clearly, but frequent grammatical errors detract from overall clarity. Strengthening the control over sentence structure and grammar would significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. While some complex sentences are attempted, their execution often falters, impacting the overall readability.
