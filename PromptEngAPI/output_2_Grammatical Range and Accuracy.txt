The essay demonstrates some strengths in grammatical range and accuracy but also presents notable weaknesses. Successful elements include a variety of sentence structures, such as complex sentences: "As a result, children are instilled with the habit of re-cycling and segregating waste at an early age." However, there are several grammatical errors, such as "is been regarded" (should be "has been regarded") and "tutors have authority over their pupils hence they pick up subject matters efficiently" (which could be clearer with improved punctuation and structure). Additionally, some phrases are awkward or unclear, such as “the fundamentals of achieving the same rely on reprocessing the waste,” which affects coherence. Overall, the essay would benefit from increased grammatical accuracy and refinement in expression.
