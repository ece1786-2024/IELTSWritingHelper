The essay presents a clear understanding of the task, addressing both viewpoints effectively. However, there are several grammatical issues that detract from its overall accuracy. For example, phrases like "is been regarded" and "Educational institute emphasis" contain errors that disrupt clarity. Linking devices such as "therefore" and "consequently" are used, but the connection between sentences could be smoother. Additionally, some sentences are overly complex, leading to confusion, such as "the impact of plastic and non-biodegradable materials on earthâ€™s soil, as these take up nearly million years to decompose." Improving accuracy and range would enhance the coherence of the argument. Overall, the essay demonstrates a fair attempt at organization but requires refinement in grammar to strengthen the response.
