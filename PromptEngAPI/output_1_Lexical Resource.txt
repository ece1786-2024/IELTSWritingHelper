The essay demonstrates a fair range of vocabulary and employs some varied phrases, showcasing an ability to convey ideas effectively. However, there are areas for improvement in lexical resource. For example, the phrase “it has more positive effects than harmful” could be more clearly expressed as “it has more positive effects than negative ones.” The usage of “omnipresent” is strong, yet phrases like “the major success goes to awareness campaign help by famous personality” contain awkward constructions that undermine clarity. Additionally, the absence of synonyms for repeated terms (e.g., "advertisement") detracts from lexical variety. Overall, the essay could benefit from clearer expressions and more sophisticated word choices to enhance clarity and coherence.
