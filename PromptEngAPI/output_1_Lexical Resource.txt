The essay presents a clear position, arguing that advertising has more positive effects than negative impacts. However, lexical resource shows some weaknesses. For example, the phrase "encircled with various types of advertisements" is awkwardly phrased; "surrounded by various advertisements" would be more natural. While the essay includes relevant vocabulary like "impulsive shopping" and "awareness campaigns," it suffers from repetitive connections and lacks precision in expressions like, "the critical impacts are also not avoidable," which could be clearer. Overall, while the essay addresses the prompt adequately, there is insufficient development and support for some ideas, indicating a need for enhanced vocabulary proficiency and variation.
