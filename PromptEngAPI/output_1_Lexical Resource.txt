The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary, effectively addressing the task with a mix of common and some less common words. Phrases like "encircled with various types of advertisements" and "bind user with interest" indicate an attempt to use descriptive language, which enhances clarity. However, there are notable spelling and word formation errors, such as "influence of it" (should be "influenced by it") and "experience of advertisement of junk food" (should be "advertisements for junk food"), which detract from overall comprehension. Additionally, inconsistent use of articles and plural forms creates minor confusion. Overall, while the vocabulary used serves the communication purpose, greater precision and fewer errors would enhance clarity significantly.
