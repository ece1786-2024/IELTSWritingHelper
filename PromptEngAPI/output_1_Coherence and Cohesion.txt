The essay addresses the task by discussing both the positive and negative impacts of advertising, thereby touching on all parts of the prompt. However, the coherence and cohesion are occasionally weak. For instance, the transition between ideas could be smoother; phrases like "However, the critical impacts are also not avoidable" disrupt the flow. Additionally, some main ideas, such as the statement about advertisements educating people, lack adequate development and supporting details. The conclusion is present but somewhat repetitive, summarizing without a clear resolution. Strengthening the connections between ideas and ensuring each main point is fully developed would enhance the overall coherence and cohesion of the essay.
