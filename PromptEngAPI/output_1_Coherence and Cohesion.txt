The essay exhibits some coherence, but it struggles with logical organization and clarity in paragraphing. Each paragraph presents a central idea; however, transitions between points can be confusing. For instance, in the first paragraph, the jump from discussing advertising's saturation to its positive impact lacks a clear link, reducing overall cohesion. While it uses some linking devices, they are sometimes improperly applied, as seen in the abrupt shift to negative impacts without a smooth transition. Additionally, referencing is present but not always clear, which can leave readers puzzled about connections. Enhanced structure and more precise linking could significantly improve the essay's clarity and flow.
