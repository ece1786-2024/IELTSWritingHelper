The essay demonstrates some level of coherence and cohesion, but it has notable weaknesses. The introduction presents the topic well, although there are issues with clarity and grammatical structure, such as "it has more positive effects than harmful," which could be clearer. Transition phrases are often missing, resulting in a lack of smooth flow between points. For example, the shift from discussing the positive aspects of advertising to the negative aspects is abrupt. Additionally, some sentences are overly long or convoluted, hindering readability. To improve coherence, clearer thematic grouping of ideas and the use of linking phrases would strengthen logical connections between arguments. Overall, while the essay's structure is apparent, improvement in clarity and transitions is necessary for higher band scores.
