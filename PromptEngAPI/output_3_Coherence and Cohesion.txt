The essay displays a clear structure with distinct paragraphs for each viewpoint, which aids coherence. However, some points could benefit from clearer transitions; for example, the shift between the advantages and disadvantages could be smoother for better flow. The use of phrases like "machines pose a number of demerits" effectively signals a transition, but it could be more explicitly linked to the previous paragraph for cohesion. Additionally, the phrase "mechanical bodies" feels somewhat repetitive; varying word choice could enhance clarity. While the essay communicates its ideas effectively, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "a pro-machine community") affects overall cohesion. With more varied vocabulary and smoother links, the essay could achieve stronger coherence.
