The essay demonstrates a solid structure with clear paragraphs addressing both views. However, the coherence could be improved by ensuring smoother transitions between ideas. For instance, the introduction succinctly outlines the debate but could more explicitly signal the organization of the essay. The use of examples enhances cohesion, such as the reference to Audi's use of robots. Nonetheless, there is inconsistency in the clarity of points; for example, the example from Japan lacks context and an introductory sentence, making it feel abrupt. Overall, while the essay communicates its main ideas effectively, more cohesive linking and clearer transitions would strengthen the overall coherence.
