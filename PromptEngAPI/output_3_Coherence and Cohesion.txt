The essay demonstrates a coherent structure, effectively organizing information into clear paragraphs that address both views. However, the central topic within the second paragraph could be more clearly defined, as it mixes examples with general statements about the effectiveness of machines. The use of linking devices is generally appropriate, but phrases like "on one hand" should align with "on the other hand" for better cohesion. Additionally, referencing could be improved; for instance, the sentence about Japan lacks clear context. Overall, while the ideas flow logically, some grammatical errors and vague references disrupt coherence. Strengthening paragraph topics and refining connections between ideas would enhance the overall cohesion of the essay.
