The essay addresses the prompt by discussing both opinions on whether recycling should be taught at school or at home, and it provides a personal opinion. However, it lacks clear, balanced analysis of both sides since one viewpoint is elaborated more extensively. The conclusion presents a reasonable opinion but could better summarize the key points made. Overall, the task is partially achieved, but clearer argumentation and balance in discussing both perspectives would enhance the response.
