The essay demonstrates a reasonable attempt to address the prompt, presenting both positive and negative aspects of advertising. However, grammatical range and accuracy suffer in several areas. For instance, phrases like "it add major value" and "this approach add up to the stress" indicate subject-verb agreement issues. Additionally, the use of punctuation is inconsistent, with run-on sentences, such as "However, the critical impacts are also not avoidable.Firstly," highlighting a need for better separation of ideas.

The ideas are relevant, but the development is often vague or overly general, leading to an unclear position in some paragraphs. Overall, while the essay addresses the task, the grammatical inaccuracies hinder clarity and effectiveness.
