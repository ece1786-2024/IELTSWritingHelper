The essay demonstrates a reasonable variety of sentence structures, including both simple and complex sentences. However, it features several grammatical errors that hinder clarity. For instance, in the phrase "In my view, it has more positive effects than harmful," the use of "harmful" should be corrected to "harmful effects" for better grammatical accuracy. Additionally, punctuation errors, such as the lack of a comma after "However," affect readability. Although the essay presents clear communication of ideas, the frequent mistakes suggest a need for improved grammatical control. Overall, while the essay engages with the prompt effectively, greater accuracy and range in grammatical use would enhance its quality.
