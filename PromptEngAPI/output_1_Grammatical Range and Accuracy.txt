The essay demonstrates a reasonable grammatical range but contains several inaccuracies that impact clarity and coherence. For example, phrases like "people are in influence of it" and "this phenomenon is escalating to extremely new level" could be better expressed as "people are influenced by it" and "this phenomenon is escalating to a whole new level." Additionally, inconsistent capitalization, such as "In India" and "TV advertisements," detracts from professionalism. The use of varied sentence structures is evident, yet some sentences lack proper punctuation or conjunctions, making them difficult to follow. Overall, while the essay conveys ideas adequately, attention to grammar and accuracy is needed for improved performance.
