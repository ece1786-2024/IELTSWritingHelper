The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, expressing ideas clearly. Phrases like "waste management" and "profound topic" indicate a good understanding of context. However, the use of "been regarded" is incorrect and should be "regarded," which reflects a problem with word formation. Additionally, terms such as "cognitive skills" and "instilled with the habit" show some attempt at precision, but the overall lexical choices lack variety. Mistakes like "recycling waste" instead of "recycling materials" and "the thumb rule" instead of "a general rule" weaken the communication slightly. Overall, the vocabulary usage is competent, but there are notable errors that detract from its effectiveness.
