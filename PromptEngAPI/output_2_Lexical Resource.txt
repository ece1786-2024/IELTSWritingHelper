The essay demonstrates a good range of vocabulary related to recycling and environmental issues, which enhances its relevance. Phrases like "reprocessing the waste" and "behavioural attributes" showcase a competent lexical resource. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors, such as "Green energy is been regarded" and "institutional in developing children cognitive skills," which detract from clarity. Additionally, some vocabulary choices appear repetitive, particularly in referencing "waste" without sufficient variety. Overall, while there is some effective use of vocabulary, improving grammatical accuracy and expanding lexical variety would strengthen the essay further.
