The essay demonstrates a satisfactory use of lexical resource, although it could benefit from greater variety and precision. For instance, phrases like "all good behaviours are cultivated here" lack specificity and strength; a more precise word choice, like "positive habits" or "responsible behaviors," would enhance clarity. Additionally, the expression "students comprehend the reason and significance of reducing waste" could be simplified to "students understand the importance of waste reduction." While some vocabulary, such as "reprocessing" and "toxic," is appropriate, there are instances of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors, such as "is been regarded" and "an in-depth analysis of how the process works or implemented." Improving these areas could elevate the overall effectiveness of the essay.
