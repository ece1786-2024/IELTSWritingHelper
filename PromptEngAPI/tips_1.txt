To enhance the effectiveness of the essay, a few strategic improvements can be made. Firstly, it is essential to clarify the stance regarding advertising's impact. Although the author states a belief that advertising has more positive effects, this position needs to be more consistently and emphatically presented throughout the essay. The examples provided, such as the campaign against polio, effectively illustrate the advantages of advertising, but the negative aspects, like the promotion of consumerism or exposure to violence, should be elaborated upon with equal depth. For instance, when mentioning how advertising leads to impulsive shopping and increasing obesity, the author could include statistics or findings from studies to substantiate these claims, thereby strengthening the argument for balancing both sides of advertising’s impact.

Moreover, improving cohesion within paragraphs will greatly enhance readability. The transitions between points are sometimes abrupt; therefore, using more effective linking phrases could facilitate smoother connections. A better transition from discussing positive aspects to negative ones could be achieved by stating, “While there are undeniable benefits, such as [insert example], it is crucial to acknowledge the adverse effects, particularly the impact on children and consumer behavior.” This provides a clearer flow of ideas and helps the reader easily follow the argument.

Additionally, careful attention to grammatical accuracy and vocabulary is necessary. Correcting errors like “the major success goes to awareness campaign help” to “the major success can be attributed to awareness campaigns” enhances clarity and professionalism. Lastly, the conclusion should synthesize the discussion better rather than just summarizing; it could suggest a path forward, such as promoting ethical advertising practices that mitigate negative effects. Overall, these improvements in structure, coherence, and grammatical accuracy will significantly refine the essay's overall quality and depth, allowing for a more persuasive argument.
