The essay addresses the task by presenting a clear opinion that advertisements have more positive effects than negative ones, which directly responds to the prompt. However, the argument could be better developed through clearer point delineation and stronger support for the positive aspects compared to the negatives. While it acknowledges some harmful effects, the conclusion seems to downplay the significance of these impacts, which should be balanced more effectively. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the topic but lacks depth in discussing the extent of agreement with the statement.
