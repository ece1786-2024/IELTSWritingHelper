The essay does address the task by discussing both positive and negative effects of advertising; however, it ultimately leans towards arguing that the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. Strengths include a clear presentation of points, such as the role of advertising in awareness campaigns like polio, which supports the argument. However, weaknesses arise from a lack of depth; for example, the mention of negative impacts could be expanded with stronger examples or statistics to substantiate claims. The conclusion summarizes the argument well but could more clearly articulate the extent to which the writer agrees or disagrees with the prompt. Overall, the response partially meets the task requirements but could benefit from more balanced discussion and stronger evidence.
