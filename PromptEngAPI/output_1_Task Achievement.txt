The essay addresses the task by discussing the positive and negative impacts of advertising, thus engaging with both aspects of the prompt. The writer clearly presents a position favoring the positive effects of advertising while acknowledging its drawbacks. However, the development of main ideas varies; for instance, while the example of polio awareness is relevant, the link between advertisements and rising obesity is mentioned but not effectively elaborated. Although a conclusion is provided, it could be stronger and clearer. Overall, while the essay engages with the prompt and presents a relevant viewpoint, the development of some ideas lacks depth and focus.
