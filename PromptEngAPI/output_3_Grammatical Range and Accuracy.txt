The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary, addressing the task effectively. However, there are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that can hinder understanding, such as “high rate of unemployment is another problem that will be faced,” which could be more clearly stated. The use of “mechanical bodies” and “lifeless counterparts” shows an attempt at precision, although “mechanical objects” might be clearer in context. Additionally, the sentence “in ,Japan many people no longer walk” contains a punctuation error that disrupts flow. Overall, while the meaning is communicated, enhancing grammatical accuracy and correcting specific errors would improve clarity and coherence.
