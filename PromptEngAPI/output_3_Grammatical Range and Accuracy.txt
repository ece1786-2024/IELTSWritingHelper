The essay demonstrates a fair level of grammatical range and accuracy, with several strengths and weaknesses noted. The use of varied sentence structures is evident, especially in the discussion of both views, which helps enhance cohesion. For example, the phrase “high dependence on these mechanical objects can lead to a sedentary lifestyle” showcases a compound structure. However, there are errors that detract from overall clarity, such as in “in ,Japan” where a misplaced comma disrupts the flow. Additionally, the phrase “this does not portend well for society” is complex but could be more clearly articulated. Overall, while the essay effectively conveys its ideas, attention to detail in grammar would strengthen its accuracy.
