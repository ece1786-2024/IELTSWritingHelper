The essay demonstrates a fair range of grammatical structures, using a mix of simple and complex sentences. However, it contains several errors that affect clarity, such as in the phrase "such a task will be arduous for humans," which should be corrected to "such tasks would be arduous for humans." The sentence, "in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping," has a punctuation error, as the comma is misplaced. The author shows an understanding of basic grammatical rules but occasionally lacks consistent accuracy and control, which may disrupt reader comprehension. Strengthening punctuation and revising sentence structures will enhance clarity and overall quality.
