To enhance the quality of the essay addressing the role of robots in future societies, several key improvements can be implemented. First, the introduction could benefit from a clearer statement of the writer's position; rather than simply stating an inclination towards the negative perspective, clearly asserting that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages right at the beginning can provide a stronger foundation for the argument. For example, replacing "I am inclined to agree with the latter" with "I firmly believe that the negative impacts of robots significantly overshadow their benefits" would provide clearer guidance to the reader regarding the writer’s stance.

Furthermore, developing the arguments more thoroughly will add depth to the essay. While examples like Audi and shopping behaviors in Japan are relevant, elaborating on these points would strengthen the overall argument. For instance, when discussing the effectiveness of machines in manufacturing, consider expanding on how the use of robots at Audi has not only streamlined car production but might also have resulted in specific job losses for skilled workers, thereby illustrating the broader implications on employment.

In terms of coherence, ensuring that linking devices are used consistently is crucial. The phrase, "on one hand," should be matched with "on the other hand" to maintain parallelism and clarity, thus enhancing the essay’s flow. Additionally, replacing vague phrases such as "these mechanical bodies" with more precise terminology, like "industrial robots," would clarify references and improve understanding.

Lastly, addressing grammatical issues such as punctuation and sentence structure is essential for clarity. For example, correcting the sentence “in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping” to “In Japan, many people no longer walk to go shopping” removes the unnecessary comma and enhances readability. By incorporating these modifications, the overall clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness of the essay can be significantly improved, contributing to a more compelling discussion on the impacts of robots in society.
