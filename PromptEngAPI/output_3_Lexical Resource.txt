The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary but lacks some precision and variety in word choice. For instance, terms like "mechanical bodies" and "lifeless counterparts" reflect a less common vocabulary, yet their meanings might not be entirely clear to the reader. Moreover, phrases such as "these mechanical bodies couple over 1,000 vehicles," while creative, could confuse the audience about the intended action. While spelling and word formation are generally accurate, errors like "in ,Japan" disrupt the flow and clarity. Overall, the essay communicates its ideas clearly but could benefit from more precise language and greater lexical flexibility to enhance the impact of the arguments presented.
