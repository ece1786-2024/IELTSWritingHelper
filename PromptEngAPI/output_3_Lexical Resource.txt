The essay demonstrates a good range of vocabulary and expressions relevant to the topic, contributing to effective communication of ideas. Phrases like "heavy dependence on robots" and "sedentary lifestyle" show a clear understanding of the subject matter. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as "machines pose a number of demerits," which could be expressed more naturally as "machines have several drawbacks." Additionally, there's a minor inconsistency in the example regarding Japan, where a comma is incorrectly placed before "Japan." Overall, while the use of lexical resource is competent, improving precision and fluency in expression would enhance clarity.
