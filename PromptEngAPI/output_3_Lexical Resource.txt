The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, with some attempts to use less common terms like "contrasting views" and "sedentary lifestyle." However, the use of phrases such as "profitable to society" could be expressed more precisely. There are occasional spelling errors, such as the misplaced comma before "Japan," which detracts from clarity. Overall, while the communication is generally clear, the vocabulary could be more varied and precise to better convey nuanced meanings. More sophisticated word choices and collocations would enhance the overall lexical resource of the essay.
