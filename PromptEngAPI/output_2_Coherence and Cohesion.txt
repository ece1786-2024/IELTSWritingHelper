The essay exhibits some strengths in coherence and cohesion, particularly in its clear structure, with separate paragraphs for each viewpoint and a conclusion. However, it suffers from a few weaknesses. The transitions between ideas could be more fluid; for example, the phrase "while some argue" could be more effectively linked to the subsequent discussion. Additionally, sentences are at times convoluted, making it difficult for readers to follow the argument, such as “the fundamentals of achieving the same rely on reprocessing the waste.” Clearer and more concise wording would enhance readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a clear argument, improved clarity and flow would strengthen coherence and cohesion.
