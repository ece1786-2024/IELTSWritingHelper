The essay demonstrates a fair level of coherence and cohesion, with some strengths and weaknesses. The introduction clearly outlines the two perspectives, although the phrase "education on recycling waste can be beneficial" could benefit from clearer referencing to the earlier points discussed. Paragraphs are used effectively, addressing specific topics—schools and homes—but some transitions between ideas feel abrupt, such as the shift from discussing school education directly to parental influence. Additionally, the essay overuses "waste" and similar terms without sufficient variety, risking repetition. Overall, while ideas are organized logically, improving linking devices and enhancing variety in vocabulary would strengthen coherence further.
