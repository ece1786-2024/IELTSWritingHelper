The essay demonstrates a good attempt at organizing information around the topic of recycling education. It maintains clear paragraphing, with each paragraph discussing a central idea related to either school or home education. However, some linking devices are used inconsistently, leading to occasional confusion, such as "while waste management is a profound topic." The transition between ideas could be smoother. Additionally, referencing is present but not always executed clearly, for example, using "these materials" without precise antecedents. Overall, the essay has a logical flow but could benefit from improved transitions and clearer references to enhance coherence.
