The essay adequately addresses the prompt by discussing both perspectives on the role of robots in society, ultimately presenting a clear opinion. A strength of the response is its balanced evaluation; it highlights both the efficiency of robots in manufacturing and the societal drawbacks, such as sedentary lifestyles and unemployment. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing a more detailed examination of the benefits of robots, as the examples primarily focus on negative effects. For instance, while the mention of Audi's usage of robots is relevant, elaborating on the positive impacts, such as increased production efficiency, would provide a more nuanced discussion. Overall, the essay demonstrates sound task achievement, but further depth on the positive side would enhance it.
