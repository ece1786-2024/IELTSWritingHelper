The essay effectively addresses the prompt by discussing both views on the role of robots in society and providing the authorâ€™s opinion. It contains a clear argument regarding the negative aspects of robots, such as promoting an inactive lifestyle and causing unemployment, which is well-supported by examples from Japan and India. However, the essay could be improved by providing more balanced arguments for the positive side and incorporating a greater variety of vocabulary, particularly in expressing nuanced ideas. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "in ,Japan," which detracts from clarity. Overall, the essay demonstrates adequate task achievement but has room for enhancement in depth and linguistic precision.
