The essay addresses the task by discussing both views on the role of robots in future societies, as well as presenting the writerâ€™s opinion. It effectively outlines the benefits of robots in manufacturing and the drawbacks related to health issues and unemployment. However, the clarity of the position could be improved, particularly in the conclusion, where the argument against robots is somewhat vague. The points raised are relevant, such as the example of Audi and the situation in Japan and India, though the development of these ideas could be more thorough. Overall, while the essay covers the essential aspects, stronger development and clearer links between ideas would strengthen the response.
