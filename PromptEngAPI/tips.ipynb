      "Prompt: Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Essay: In this digital world, people are encircled with various types of advertisements. It is omnipresent for all, TV adverts, Social Media Marketing, billboards, Personal advertisements and many more diverse ways. while this phenomenon is escalating to extremely new level, people are in influence of it. In my view, it has more positive effects than harmful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of advertisements, people are aware of current products in market. At some extent, it educates the people and provides the knowledge. For an instance, In India serious disease like  polio is no more and the major success goes to awareness campaign help by famous personality with the use of digital marketing and TV advertisements. Moreover, to bind user with interest usually companies display various new idea and it add major value in entertainment world.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the critical impacts are also not avoidable.Firstly, it exposes kids and young generation towards the violence and  inappropriate content sometime. Secondly, Advertisements with various discounts and offers, make people lure to do impulsive shopping. Increasing obesity is also one of consequence of advertisement of junk food. In addition, few times people get influenced by various advertisings and tend to work more to achieve never ending desire of buying stuff, this approach add up to the stress and frustration. What more, kids might suffer from harmful psychological effects when their parents are unable to afford various products shown in advertisements.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put this in a nutshell, I can say that advertisement is beneficial phenomenon with a number of insignificant drawbacks. In my view, negative advertising effects can be lowered with help of government using stringent approach and awareness campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance the effectiveness of the essay, a few strategic improvements can be made. Firstly, it is essential to clarify the stance regarding advertising's impact. Although the author states a belief that advertising has more positive effects, this position needs to be more consistently and emphatically presented throughout the essay. The examples provided, such as the campaign against polio, effectively illustrate the advantages of advertising, but the negative aspects, like the promotion of consumerism or exposure to violence, should be elaborated upon with equal depth. For instance, when mentioning how advertising leads to impulsive shopping and increasing obesity, the author could include statistics or findings from studies to substantiate these claims, thereby strengthening the argument for balancing both sides of advertising’s impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, improving cohesion within paragraphs will greatly enhance readability. The transitions between points are sometimes abrupt; therefore, using more effective linking phrases could facilitate smoother connections. A better transition from discussing positive aspects to negative ones could be achieved by stating, “While there are undeniable benefits, such as [insert example], it is crucial to acknowledge the adverse effects, particularly the impact on children and consumer behavior.” This provides a clearer flow of ideas and helps the reader easily follow the argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, careful attention to grammatical accuracy and vocabulary is necessary. Correcting errors like “the major success goes to awareness campaign help” to “the major success can be attributed to awareness campaigns” enhances clarity and professionalism. Lastly, the conclusion should synthesize the discussion better rather than just summarizing; it could suggest a path forward, such as promoting ethical advertising practices that mitigate negative effects. Overall, these improvements in structure, coherence, and grammatical accuracy will significantly refine the essay's overall quality and depth, allowing for a more persuasive argument.\n",

      "The essay addresses the task by discussing both opinions on whether recycling should be taught at school or home, which is a clear strength. It presents a relevant position, suggesting that both environments are important for teaching children about recycling. However, the development of ideas is somewhat weak; for example, the argument for teaching recycling at school lacks depth and could benefit from more specific examples or elaboration. Moreover, the conclusion reiterates the main points but could be clearer and more concise. Overall, while the essay meets the task requirements, further development and clearer examples would enhance the effectiveness of the arguments presented.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates a good attempt at organizing information around the topic of recycling education. It maintains clear paragraphing, with each paragraph discussing a central idea related to either school or home education. However, some linking devices are used inconsistently, leading to occasional confusion, such as \"while waste management is a profound topic.\" The transition between ideas could be smoother. Additionally, referencing is present but not always executed clearly, for example, using \"these materials\" without precise antecedents. Overall, the essay has a logical flow but could benefit from improved transitions and clearer references to enhance coherence.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, expressing ideas clearly. Phrases like \"waste management\" and \"profound topic\" indicate a good understanding of context. However, the use of \"been regarded\" is incorrect and should be \"regarded,\" which reflects a problem with word formation. Additionally, terms such as \"cognitive skills\" and \"instilled with the habit\" show some attempt at precision, but the overall lexical choices lack variety. Mistakes like \"recycling waste\" instead of \"recycling materials\" and \"the thumb rule\" instead of \"a general rule\" weaken the communication slightly. Overall, the vocabulary usage is competent, but there are notable errors that detract from its effectiveness.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates a reasonable grammatical range with attempts to use both simple and complex sentences. However, there are notable weaknesses in grammatical accuracy. For instance, \"Green energy is been regarded\" contains an incorrect verb form, leading to confusion. Additionally, punctuation errors such as the missing space after commas make certain sentences difficult to read. There is a commendable effort to present arguments clearly, but frequent grammatical errors detract from overall clarity. Strengthening the control over sentence structure and grammar would significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. While some complex sentences are attempted, their execution often falters, impacting the overall readability.\n",

      "\n",
      "Essay: Green energy is been regarded as the future energy for mankind, moreover,the fundamentals of achieving the same rely on reprocessing the waste. While some argue this should be educated at school level and others would like this initiative done from their homes. In this essay, we shall discuss both views and state my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, schools have been institutional in developing children cognitive skills therefore all good behaviours are cultivated here. While waste management is a profound topic and requires an in-depth analysis of how the process works or implemented. Furthermore, tutors have authority over their pupils hence they pick up subject matters efficiently. Educational institute emphasis on reusing most of the resources at school, adding to this, student comprehend the reason and significance of reducing waste such as plastic and glass. For instance, Science as a subject, demonstrates the impact of plastic and non-biodegradable materials on earth’s soil, as these take up nearly million years to decompose, consequently converting these materials to toxic and destroying mother nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, young people often look up to their parents as inspiration to learn life skills. As they spend quality time at home, all behavioural attributes of kids are related to  them, so they should bring upon the habits of recycling waste at home. For example, when parents bring thumb rule of segregating waste at their homes, children at young age practice to keep waste as per the category and this behaviour can be carried across at various places like parks, social events, and public transport. As a result, children are instilled with the habit of re-cycling and segregating waste at an early age\n",

      "To conclude, education on recycling waste can be beneficial as it explains the impacts on the environment and what could be done to avoid this catastrophe. Also,parenting should ensure their children learn the habit of separating waste at home. In my opinion, both methodologies must be implemented to have a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance the effectiveness of your IELTS Task 2 essay, consider focusing on deepening your arguments and improving your language precision. While you successfully address both perspectives regarding the teaching of recycling at school and home, the development of your ideas often lacks detail and specificity. For example, when discussing the role of schools, you could elaborate further by mentioning specific programs or initiatives that schools could implement, such as establishing recycling clubs or conducting environmental science classes that highlight local recycling efforts. This would not only strengthen your argument but also provide clear examples to support your points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, improving the clarity of your transitions will enhance coherence. For instance, instead of saying, \"while waste management is a profound topic,\" you could say, \"While waste management is undoubtedly important, the way schools educate students about it can profoundly impact their understanding and actions.\" This helps create a smoother flow between ideas. It's also essential to ensure that your references are clear; rather than using vague phrases like \"these materials\" or \"this behaviour,\" specify what you mean by redesigning sentences to include direct references such as \"recycling plastic waste\" or \"the habit of segregating household waste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, pay attention to your word choice and grammatical accuracy. For instance, the phrase \"is been regarded\" should be corrected to \"is regarded\" to eliminate grammatical errors. Aim for variety in vocabulary to demonstrate lexical range; instead of repeating words like \"waste,\" consider synonyms such as \"refuse\" or \"recyclables.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, your conclusion could benefit from greater conciseness. Rather than reiterating all points, try synthesizing your ideas into a more succinct statement that emphasizes the value of education in recycling both at school and home. Refining these aspects will lead to a more polished and persuasive essay.\n",

      "The essay addresses the task by discussing both views on the role of robots in future societies, as well as presenting the writer’s opinion. It effectively outlines the benefits of robots in manufacturing and the drawbacks related to health issues and unemployment. However, the clarity of the position could be improved, particularly in the conclusion, where the argument against robots is somewhat vague. The points raised are relevant, such as the example of Audi and the situation in Japan and India, though the development of these ideas could be more thorough. Overall, while the essay covers the essential aspects, stronger development and clearer links between ideas would strengthen the response.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates a coherent structure, effectively organizing information into clear paragraphs that address both views. However, the central topic within the second paragraph could be more clearly defined, as it mixes examples with general statements about the effectiveness of machines. The use of linking devices is generally appropriate, but phrases like \"on one hand\" should align with \"on the other hand\" for better cohesion. Additionally, referencing could be improved; for instance, the sentence about Japan lacks clear context. Overall, while the ideas flow logically, some grammatical errors and vague references disrupt coherence. Strengthening paragraph topics and refining connections between ideas would enhance the overall cohesion of the essay.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary but lacks some precision and variety in word choice. For instance, terms like \"mechanical bodies\" and \"lifeless counterparts\" reflect a less common vocabulary, yet their meanings might not be entirely clear to the reader. Moreover, phrases such as \"these mechanical bodies couple over 1,000 vehicles,\" while creative, could confuse the audience about the intended action. While spelling and word formation are generally accurate, errors like \"in ,Japan\" disrupt the flow and clarity. Overall, the essay communicates its ideas clearly but could benefit from more precise language and greater lexical flexibility to enhance the impact of the arguments presented.\n",
      "The essay demonstrates a fair range of grammatical structures, using a mix of simple and complex sentences. However, it contains several errors that affect clarity, such as in the phrase \"such a task will be arduous for humans,\" which should be corrected to \"such tasks would be arduous for humans.\" The sentence, \"in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping,\" has a punctuation error, as the comma is misplaced. The author shows an understanding of basic grammatical rules but occasionally lacks consistent accuracy and control, which may disrupt reader comprehension. Strengthening punctuation and revising sentence structures will enhance clarity and overall quality.\n",

      "Prompt: Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society.\n",
      "Discuss both views and give your opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "Essay: The advancement of technology is seen in almost all part of human life. This has caused contrasting views, with some people believing that there is more profit to society if machines play substantial roles, and others arguing otherwise. I am inclined to agree with the latter, as heavy dependence on robots will lead to an inactive lifestyle, and also a high rate of unemployment is another problem that will be faced. \n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, Machines can prove very effective in areas that require repetition and also tasks such as lifting heavy objects. This is useful, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, Audi, a foremost automobile company, already uses robots to assemble its newest release of cars.  Furthermore, these mechanical bodies couple over 1,000 vehicles in a day, such a task will be arduous for humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, machines pose a number of demerits. Firstly, high dependence on these mechanical objects can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. For example, in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping, as drones have been provided by many shop vendors. Consequently, this leads to health-related problems, such as spinal curvature, and this does not portend well for  society. Secondly, a pro-machine community will lead to a high rate of joblessness, as employers find these mechanical bodies more efficient and cheaper. For instance, in India reports show that many employees are replaced by their lifeless counterparts and this will only increase over time. There is already a cry among the population due to the high rate of retrenchment by companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, robots have their own usefulness especially when it comes to carrying out mundane tasks. However, the negative impacts such as laziness and joblessness they cause to  society do not make them admirable as they are perceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance the quality of the essay addressing the role of robots in future societies, several key improvements can be implemented. First, the introduction could benefit from a clearer statement of the writer's position; rather than simply stating an inclination towards the negative perspective, clearly asserting that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages right at the beginning can provide a stronger foundation for the argument. For example, replacing \"I am inclined to agree with the latter\" with \"I firmly believe that the negative impacts of robots significantly overshadow their benefits\" would provide clearer guidance to the reader regarding the writer’s stance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, developing the arguments more thoroughly will add depth to the essay. While examples like Audi and shopping behaviors in Japan are relevant, elaborating on these points would strengthen the overall argument. For instance, when discussing the effectiveness of machines in manufacturing, consider expanding on how the use of robots at Audi has not only streamlined car production but might also have resulted in specific job losses for skilled workers, thereby illustrating the broader implications on employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of coherence, ensuring that linking devices are used consistently is crucial. The phrase, \"on one hand,\" should be matched with \"on the other hand\" to maintain parallelism and clarity, thus enhancing the essay’s flow. Additionally, replacing vague phrases such as \"these mechanical bodies\" with more precise terminology, like \"industrial robots,\" would clarify references and improve understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, addressing grammatical issues such as punctuation and sentence structure is essential for clarity. For example, correcting the sentence “in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping” to “In Japan, many people no longer walk to go shopping” removes the unnecessary comma and enhances readability. By incorporating these modifications, the overall clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness of the essay can be significantly improved, contributing to a more compelling discussion on the impacts of robots in society.\n"
