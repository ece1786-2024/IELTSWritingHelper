However, the position is somewhat unclear, as the author asserts it has \"more positive effects\" without thoroughly justifying this stance throughout the essay. For example, while the author provides a strong case for the benefits of advertising, such as awareness campaigns for health issues, the negatives mentioned, like violence exposure and consumerism, could be developed further to enhance balance and depth.

While it uses some linking devices, they are sometimes improperly applied, as seen in the abrupt shift to negative impacts without a smooth transition.

      "The essay demonstrates an adequate range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, expressing ideas clearly. Phrases like \"waste management\" and \"profound topic\" indicate a good understanding of context. However, the use of \"been regarded\" is incorrect and should be \"regarded,\" which reflects a problem with word formation. Additionally, terms such as \"cognitive skills\" and \"instilled with the habit\" show some attempt at precision, but the overall lexical choices lack variety. Mistakes like \"recycling waste\" instead of \"recycling materials\" and \"the thumb rule\" instead of \"a general rule\" weaken the communication slightly. Overall, the vocabulary usage is competent, but there are notable errors that detract from its effectiveness.\n",

Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.\n",

      "Essay: Green energy is been regarded as the future energy for mankind, moreover,the fundamentals of achieving the same rely on reprocessing the waste. While some argue this should be educated at school level and others would like this initiative done from their homes. In this essay, we shall discuss both views and state my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, schools have been institutional in developing children cognitive skills therefore all good behaviours are cultivated here. While waste management is a profound topic and requires an in-depth analysis of how the process works or implemented. Furthermore, tutors have authority over their pupils hence they pick up subject matters efficiently. Educational institute emphasis on reusing most of the resources at school, adding to this, student comprehend the reason and significance of reducing waste such as plastic and glass. For instance, Science as a subject, demonstrates the impact of plastic and non-biodegradable materials on earth’s soil, as these take up nearly million years to decompose, consequently converting these materials to toxic and destroying mother nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, young people often look up to their parents as inspiration to learn life skills. As they spend quality time at home, all behavioural attributes of kids are related to  them, so they should bring upon the habits of recycling waste at home. For example, when parents bring thumb rule of segregating waste at their homes, children at young age practice to keep waste as per the category and this behaviour can be carried across at various places like parks, social events, and public transport. As a result, children are instilled with the habit of re-cycling and segregating waste at an early age\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, education on recycling waste can be beneficial as it explains the impacts on the environment and what could be done to avoid this catastrophe. Also,parenting should ensure their children learn the habit of separating waste at home. In my opinion, both methodologies must be implemented to have a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essay demonstrates a reasonable grammatical range with attempts to use both simple and complex sentences. However, there are notable weaknesses in grammatical accuracy. For instance, \"Green energy is been regarded\" contains an incorrect verb form, leading to confusion. Additionally, punctuation errors such as the missing space after commas make certain sentences difficult to read. There is a commendable effort to present arguments clearly, but frequent grammatical errors detract from overall clarity. Strengthening the control over sentence structure and grammar would significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. While some complex sentences are attempted, their execution often falters, impacting the overall readability.\n",

      "On one hand, Machines can prove very effective in areas that require repetition and also tasks such as lifting heavy objects. This is useful, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, Audi, a foremost automobile company, already uses robots to assemble its newest release of cars.  Furthermore, these mechanical bodies couple over 1,000 vehicles in a day, such a task will be arduous for humans.\n",

      "On the other hand, machines pose a number of demerits. Firstly, high dependence on these mechanical objects can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. For example, in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping, as drones have been provided by many shop vendors. Consequently, this leads to health-related problems, such as spinal curvature, and this does not portend well for  society. Secondly, a pro-machine community will lead to a high rate of joblessness, as employers find these mechanical bodies more efficient and cheaper. For instance, in India reports show that many employees are replaced by their lifeless counterparts and this will only increase over time. There is already a cry among the population due to the high rate of retrenchment by companies.\n",

      "The essay addresses the task by discussing both views on the role of robots in future societies, as well as presenting the writer’s opinion. It effectively outlines the benefits of robots in manufacturing and the drawbacks related to health issues and unemployment. However, the clarity of the position could be improved, particularly in the conclusion, where the argument against robots is somewhat vague. The points raised are relevant, such as the example of Audi and the situation in Japan and India, though the development of these ideas could be more thorough.

The use of linking devices is generally appropriate, but phrases like \"on one hand\" should align with \"on the other hand\" for better cohesion.
