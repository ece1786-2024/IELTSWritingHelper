However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to . Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are .

5,"Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay. 
","It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study. 

One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others.

In the today's competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience - for example new facts, new habits and so on. 
, I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own. 


","You must be very careful using definitive words such as 'always' and making statements about facts. The essay is for you to provide an opinion and to provide supporting arguments. Also, the other side of the argument about teachers that have limited knowledge or people that learn better on their own is not presented here. "
5,A popular hobby rather than a favorite passtime,"Nowadays people like to change their day by day activities according to the latest trends and also they are following popular things . This essay will explain the reason why the people are spending more time 
popular hobbies rather than their individual activities. 

Hobbies and are different for everyone; this is the human nature, . The current generations are very much in the latest trend which makes them happy and also them to make more money. For example, cricket is the most famous game in , children and playing it whenever they have free time in their daily life. This makes them become a star in this game when they reach a certain age in their life. In addition, this popularity will help them to make lots of money in their life. , there are many . 
Those aiming to spend more time to make money rather than on their own interests. However, some of them are not about the popular hobbies and interests. For instance, drinking alcohol is one of the popular hobbies low income and .

I suggest that you read several essays that have been awarded high band scores and think about how those writers have structured their essays. "
5,"Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree? 

","Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children's sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport. 

Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them. 
Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities. 
","Your essay too short, the introduction is good, as is the first paragraph but you must offer more arguments regarding why you agree or disagree. There are many spelling, punctuation and article errors. The essay is easy to follow but has the appearance of the writer running short of time. "
5,"Modern medicine helps to live a longer life. Do you agree? 
","The modern medicine is very important for living a long life. It on new technology. . Also modern medicine is human body. . Therefore I agree that the modern medicine to live longer. 

First of all, the modern medicine can prevent incurable diseases. Doctors can find some diseases very early. Then doctors can give suitable medicines to patients. New modern doctors . Also intelligent people in the world live a long life modern medicine. That is very important in the human society because their creative things are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living . 
, old population is increasing in the country. It is country's economy and third world countries. But old people are very important in human society because their experience definitely helps to . 'Experience is better than qualifications' However, old people are living a long life; it is helping others to live a long life because we can get advice from them and they are covering our culture and society. 
Moreover, modern medicine is being addictive for some people, so that they cannot live without medicine. They should take medicine all their lives. Also modern medicine is very expensive. Therefore most of poor countries modern medicine and it has taken a commercial shape, also it is depending on money. In the modern medicine human kindness. People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human friendly shape. It does not depend on money. 
To summarize; in my personal view, modern medicine is helping to live a long life . Modern technologies are being supported to find diseases very early. So doctors can take immediately. Therefore, hesitate to agree with the above mentioned statement.

5.5,"Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion. 

","It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below. 
First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father's footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons' drawbacks and to influence them. 
Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one. 
In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender. 
","This essay is too short, 190 words instead of the minimum requirement of 250. It doesn't say anything about girls being influenced by their mothers, which is also a part of the task - therefore the task is only partially covered. The sentences are not complex enough, there are grammatical mistakes and inaccuracies (see comments underlined in blue). Overall, this looks like a Band 5.5 essay "
5.5,Some people believe that having a  pet such as a  cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?,"Pets have become far more familiar within mankind community, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding animals’ hairs may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.
In term of physical benefits, the well-being conditions of elderly people with pets are more favourable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, __ the responsibility that ensure their love one being fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this though might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad living styles. Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling loneliness. Therefore, their depressing rate could be minimised.
In spite of the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of these animal hairs on their tracheas, especially those with asthma. Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, which could become even more challenge when they try t take care of others.
In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic outnumber its shortages. For such reasons, instead of discontinuing them, further support would be far more beneficial.","You have made an attempt to accomplish the task response.
