7,"Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 
","The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries. 

First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity. 
On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly. 
In conclusion, I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the good ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations.",N/A
7,"Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another? 
","In today's world due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence. It is true that 'Necessity is a mother of invention'. Internet is just like a wonder box, which contains every type of information. it has also proved a very important tool to connect people with one another. 

In today's modernized era nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones. it also takes longer to send or receive any information the Internet is the easiest way to send messages to our loved ones. Communication can be either in the form of e-mail or through text messages sent via to mobile phones. We can send and receive messages straight . 
today's young generation mostly prefers to do chatting through the Internet. During such chatting we can write messages and get replies straight away. voice chatting is . 
the advantages and disadvantages resemble two sides of one coin, also some downsides, causing people health problems poor eye-sight, back ache or migraines. Today's teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on the internet rather than in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health. 
To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools, not only for regarding every field in a very short period of time. 
","This is a great essay, well done! Remember, 'the Internet' is a proper noun, currently, there is only one. Pay attention to your punctuation - many commas are missing after linking words. Otherwise, the essay is well argued and set out."
7,The government is spending a lot of money to discover life on other planets. Some people think that government is wasting money and should spend more money addressing the problems of public.,"With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes. 
, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are . 

First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer. 
Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven't been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources. 
In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted. 
","This is a very good essay, well done."
7,"In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules? 
","Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody's life. We can see in today's modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement. 

that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing . 
In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children's bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children's main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well. 
In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future. 
","This is a good, well-written essay. Some sentences are too short and could be combined together to create a more complex structure. There is also some repetition of words, which should be avoided. Overall, nicely done."
7,"Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion. 
",", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don't think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke. 

Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs. 
Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves . 
In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere. 
","This is a very good essay, you have made your arguments well and set out the paragraphs as required. However, pay attention to your use of assertive statements e.g. 'Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs'. Perhaps they would gain employment in another industry - we cannot be sure. Over all, well done!"
7,"The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement? 
","Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen. 

Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library. 
Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at present was able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet. 
In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier. 
","This is a good essay, the arguments are clear, the language and the grammar are also fine. The structure needs to be improved a little bit - make paragraphs smaller, re-structure them to create 5 paragraphs from 4. In case of an argument essay - give your opinion in the conclusion only. In case of an opinion essay - give your opinion in the introduction"
7,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits? 
","In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? . 

Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal. 
On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters. 
In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony. 
","This is a good essay, nice vocabulary, a little too long (340 words instead of 250), a few grammatical mistakes. The topic is not fully covered (what about the “things will they be used for in future” part?)."
7,"Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words. 
","Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world. 

? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it's from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it's nothing important, it's just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget. 
On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through . 
In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all. 
","Your arguments are good and the paragraphs are set out well, however, you must be careful about making assertive statements, e.g. ' it motivates the psychological point in everyone'. How do you know that all advertisements do motivate every single person, for instance? Overall, this is a good essay, well done."
7,"Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens? 
","I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons. 

Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a . 
Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future. 
Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessary this help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations'. This can't be considered a humane action and should be prevented. 
In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side. 
","This is an excellent essay, your arguments are convincing and very well presented. There are only a few minor mistakes, please read and consider the comments. Well done!"
7,"Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss. 
","Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters' safety, according to my vision. 

Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker's brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with . 
Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues. 
To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people's health but on our society as a whole. 
","Well done! This is a good essay, however, you should take care of your spelling."
7,"Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 
","Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world. 

Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue . 
Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out. 
","This is a good essay, you should do well in the Task 2 Writing Test."
7,"Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 
","An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally. 

Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more. 
However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows. 
To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet. 
","This is a very good essay, a Band 7+ candidate. The structure of this essay and sentences is correct as well as the spelling and punctuation. Good job!"
7,"News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported? 
",". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors' decisions the most is the taste of their customers. 

The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future. 
The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can't deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors. 
In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad. 
","Some of your sentences are too short - they would look better if joined together. Overall, this is a good essay, which seems to be worthy of Band 7."
7.5,"Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another? 
","A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away. 

Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas! 
However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody's reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life - simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times. 
As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication - the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones. 
","This is a great essay, which seems worthy of Band 7 or perhaps even 8. It is longer than required (340 words instead of 250) which means that it took you more time to write and less time to check your work."
7,"In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion? 
","Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons. 

It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .  
This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school. 
Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.  
In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future. 
","This is a great essay, a Band 7+ candidate. My only suggestion is to divide your arguments so that you would have 2 paragraphs covering arguments 'against' and one covering arguments 'for' or vise versa. Don't mix arguments 'for' and 'against' in one paragraph."
7,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits? 
","Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers. 

, computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already selling 
housewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean. 
Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true. 
We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations. 
","Great essay, all the task points are covered, good language and structure. It would probably receive a Band 7."
7,"Some people think that students who don't take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree? 
","Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as 'group A' and the other group - as 'group B'. 

Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can't do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren't trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can't accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience. 
Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A's salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely. 
In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future. 
","This essay is too long (350 words instead of 250). To fight this problem, try to write in a more general form and provide fewer details. The use of language and ideas are good and so is the essay structure. Seems worthy of Band 7."
7,"Some people say that protecting the environment is the government's responsibility. Others believe that every individual should be responsible for it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. 
","People hold different views about whether the government should shoulder the responsibility of preserving the environment or each person responsible . From my standpoint, it more beneficial if both the country's authorities and individuals the responsibility. On the one hand, the government may play a pivotal role in maintaining the environment safe and healthy. It is that should introduce the legislation in order to mitigate environmental problems, such as air pollution and more. To illustrate, there should be some laws encouraging factories to move to the rather than staying in cities. This could help urban areas to be further protected from the poisonous fumes, which . Another prominent role the government could play would be creating TV programs to educate citizens, and to persuade them to more. Being informed of the consequences of their activities, individuals may endeavor to alter their ways, to avoid harming the environment. On the other hand, it is undeniable that each person can play an important role in protecting their own neighborhood. Cars are considered to be a major source of air pollution. Their exhaust gases contaminate the air, ranging from carbon dioxide to unburnt carbon. Therefore, by using their own vehicles only in rare cases, people would be able to protect the environment. Another opportunity available to individuals is recycling. By stopping plastic waste from entering and contaminating waterways people are able to conserve drinkable water and its inhabitants. In conclusion, due to the large amount of work involved, mobilising all the possible forces is a more sensible approach. It is, therefore, likely that joint efforts of both the governments and their citizens would result in the most effective way of preserving the environment. ","The author of this essay has done a good job covering the task topic. He/she used one body paragraph to discuss whether the government should be responsible for protecting the environment, and the other body paragraph - to discuss whether individuals should be protecting the environment, and how. The ideas are logically sequenced and connected using linking words, making this essay easy to read. Some inaccuracy of expression is evident and requires more work and attention (see corrections underlined in blue). The range of vocabulary is impressive and grammatical errors are quite rare. Overall this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 7."
