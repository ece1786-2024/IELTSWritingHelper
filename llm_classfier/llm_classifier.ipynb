While some argue this should be educated at school level and others would like this initiative done from their homes. In this essay, we shall discuss both views and state my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, schools have been institutional in developing children cognitive skills therefore all good behaviours are cultivated here. While waste management is a profound topic and requires an in-depth analysis of how the process works or implemented. Furthermore, tutors have authority over their pupils hence they pick up subject matters efficiently. Educational institute emphasis on reusing most of the resources at school, adding to this, student comprehend the reason and significance of reducing waste such as plastic and glass. For instance, Science as a subject, demonstrates the impact of plastic and non-biodegradable materials on earth’s soil, as these take up nearly million years to decompose, consequently converting these materials to toxic and destroying mother nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, young people often look up to their parents as inspiration to learn life skills. As they spend quality time at home, all behavioural attributes of kids are related to  them, so they should bring upon the habits of recycling waste at home. For example, when parents bring thumb rule of segregating waste at their homes, children at young age practice to keep waste as per the category and this behaviour can be carried across at various places like parks, social events, and public transport. As a result, children are instilled with the habit of re-cycling and segregating waste at an early age\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, education on recycling waste can be beneficial as it explains the impacts on the environment and what could be done to avoid this catastrophe. Also,parenting should ensure their children learn the habit of separating waste at home. In my opinion, both methodologies must be implemented to have a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment: The essay demonstrates a good attempt at organizing information around the topic of recycling education. It maintains clear paragraphing, with each paragraph discussing a central idea related to either school or home education. However, some linking devices are used inconsistently, leading to occasional confusion, such as \"while waste management is a profound topic.\" The transition between ideas could be smoother. Additionally, referencing is present but not always executed clearly, for example, using \"these materials\" without precise antecedents. Overall, the essay has a logical flow but could benefit from improved transitions and clearer references to enhance coherence.\n"

    "\n",
    "Essay: The advancement of technology is seen in almost all part of human life. This has caused contrasting views, with some people believing that there is more profit to society if machines play substantial roles, and others arguing otherwise. I am inclined to agree with the latter, as heavy dependence on robots will lead to an inactive lifestyle, and also a high rate of unemployment is another problem that will be faced. \n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, Machines can prove very effective in areas that require repetition and also tasks such as lifting heavy objects. This is useful, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, Audi, a foremost automobile company, already uses robots to assemble its newest release of cars.  Furthermore, these mechanical bodies couple over 1,000 vehicles in a day, such a task will be arduous for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, machines pose a number of demerits. Firstly, high dependence on these mechanical objects can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. For example, in ,Japan many people no longer walk to go shopping, as drones have been provided by many shop vendors. Consequently, this leads to health-related problems, such as spinal curvature, and this does not portend well for  society. Secondly, a pro-machine community will lead to a high rate of joblessness, as employers find these mechanical bodies more efficient and cheaper. For instance, in India reports show that many employees are replaced by their lifeless counterparts and this will only increase over time. There is already a cry among the population due to the high rate of retrenchment by companies.\n",

    "input2 = \"\"\"Prompt: Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ.To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
    "Essay: Job interviews are commonly undertaken by companies of all sizes seeking candidates to fill a role. They often consist of dialogues between a Human Resources representative of these organisations and the professional interested in the position. During the conversation, the applicant's profile in terms of qualifications, skills and work experience is assessed against the criteria and employer’s expectations. However, some people argue this approach is insufficient for capturing the right employee. In my opinion, to ensure a more accurate hiring process, other methodologies should be explored along with interviews, such as group activities and personality quizzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of interviews when it comes to selecting new individuals to integrate a team cannot be dinned. It has proved to be the most traditional and practical framework largely adopted worldwide. They can offer vital insights about an applicant and lead to more informed decisions. However, individuals often act like robots when being interviewed, answering questions in a way recruiters will be happy about. In this sense, other approaches should be introduced for a more holistic understanding of the candidate's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern organisations are already introducing new techniques to choose4 the best matches for their teams. These contemporary assessments evaluate professionals during activities designed to capture the candidate's behaviour in complex situations where pressure and conflicts are common.  In this case, applicants tend to express their real selves, values and logical thinking. The findings are often combined with the interview results in a profile-matching exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to further assess the job seekers' profiles is by assigning them personality quizzes. Quizzes are powerful tools that can be used to gather information about a professional’s strengths and weaknesses. In addition, these tests can detect which professionals can naturally act like mediators and which need to be led by others. Thus, they can assist in allocating workers to the right team and role.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, interviews will always be important as they are still insightful, simple, and straightforward, demanding minimum resources to be executed. Nevertheless, when combined with other methodologies, the hiring process may become more precise and efficient. In this case, companies need to invest time and money to introduce these complementary approaches, which may make sense for some businesses and positions but not the majority.\n",

In my opinion, one of the reasons is the increasing demand for people consumption lead to escalate industrial waste amounts emit into the atmosphere. This problem results from the substantial number of causes to which several solutions will be proposed in this essay.  \n",

    "On the one hand, the world’s population is increasing day by day, which is one of reason for pollution. As the growth of population, we are not using natural resources. It is believed that nothing can save when a human change their mind about safe their life environment. The industrial activities are the way to cause the air pollution and water pollution, which would damage the marine and terrestrial animals. The fact that deforestation to get the wood to make the furniture would lead to the soil erosion. There is some the solution of goods consuming, the politicians impose punishment on companies that harm to the environment during the production process.\n",

    "On the other hand, oil exploitation is a way to depletion of natural resources. For instance, some famous brands of drinks started an activity that the drink will be discounted if the costumers bring their own cup.

    "input4 = \"\"\"Prompt: If a product is good or it meets people's needs, people will buy it. So advertising is unnecessary and no more than entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essay: In the modern world, the masses purchase only those things which are of great quality and meet their requirements. Therefore, folks believe that adverts are no longer needed and just a source of entertainment. I completely disagree with the notion because advertisements help people to know about new products and it influences them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To commence with, if companies advertise their products, then the customers would come to know about their newly launched product. They not only gain information about its features, but also tell them how to use it. So, that is why advertisements are needed. For example, Apple is a renowned brand in mobile-phone and mainly known for its quality products. Recently, according to their in-house survey, it is found that there is a fifty percent decline in the sale of the newly launched phone despite its build because they did not do any promotions. Hence, advertisement plays a pivotal role to sell new products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, commercials also support the companies to push the customers to buy their goods because there is a huge competition in the market among the companies, and the number of high-quality products is available to purchase. Thus to boost the sale adverts are essential. For instance, in Inida, there are two big brands namely Bajaj and Hero Honda, who manufacture bikes. Their equipment is equally good, so to convince the folks to buy their product and boost its sale, they promote it. Thereby, it is apparent that advertising is vital to selling things.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, advertisements are important even if the product quality is good. In my opinion, it informs the masses about new launches as well as help them to choose the right product.\n",
